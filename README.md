# Interactive-Google-Sheet-Syncing-with-Folders
A straightforward approach to make Google Sheet interactive and responsive. 

Use Google Sheet built-in search function to pinpoint the searching files, conditional formatting from the Format drop-down menu to customize the options, Google Apps Script to design code to sync with the folder on the drive, and in combinaton of Trigger function to realize auto-refresh functionality.

## Note
1. You need to be the owner of the folder in order to do the sync part, or at least have permission of it.
2. This method is perfect for a decent size of data and practical for a medium dataset. The bigger, the laggier.
